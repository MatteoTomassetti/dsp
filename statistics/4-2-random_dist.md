[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

*The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*

First we generate 1000 random numbers

```
import random
numbs = 1000
rnd_numbs = [random.random() for _ in range(numbs)]
```

Next, we compute their PMF and CDF

```
import thinkstats2
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rnd_numbs)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rnd_numbs)
```

Finally, we plot the two distributions

```
import thinkplot
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Show()

thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show()
```

The distribution is uniform because the CDF is almost a perfect straight line.
