[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

_**Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?**_

**Note: The working directory is `/ThinkStats2/code` and the code is in Python 3**

The first step is to read the data and create two different DataFrames for first babies and others

```python
# importing the NSFG data
import nsfg
df = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()

firsts = df[df.birthord == 1] # first babies
others = df[df.birthord != 1] # others
```

The simplest statistics to compute in order to understand whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others is the **median**:

```python
print("Median weight for first babies = ",firsts.totalwgt_lb.median())
print("Median weight for other babies = ",others.totalwgt_lb.median())
# Median weight for first babies =  7.3125
# Median weight for other babies =  7.375
```

Based on this we find that first babies are slighlty less heavier than other babies.

Next, we compute the **Cohen's d** to quantify the difference between the two groups

```python
import math
# function that computes the Cohen's d
def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()
    
    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)
    
    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)
    d = diff / math.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return d

# printing the result
print(CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb,others.totalwgt_lb))
# -0.08893641177719079
```

We find that the fact that we are selecting first or other babies, does not have a large effect on the weight of a baby since the Cohen's d is less than 0.09 standard deviations.

The difference between the two groups in pregnancy length is also small (0.029) if one consider only pregnancies that last at least 27 weeks for other babies (just like it is reported in the book). However, if all pregnancies are considered, we find that Cohen's d for the pregnancies length is

```python
print(CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth,others.prglngth))
#1.0930083433621403
```
which means that first babies pregnancies are significantly longer than other babies pregnancies since the Cohen's d is large.
